# js-inBuilts-basic
this contain a collection of basic JavaScript inbuilt methods that I created back in 2022 while I was still learning JavaScript. It was mainly a personal learning project, where I explored different built-in functions and concepts to understand JavaScript better. Even though itâ€™s quite simple, I believe it might still be helpful to others who are starting out with JavaScript or looking for quick references to JavaScriptâ€™s inbuilt methods. Thatâ€™s why I decided to push it here!Feel free to explore, use, or even improve upon it. ðŸš€
